# Simon Game
The Simon Game is an interactive memory-based game where players must repeat an increasingly long sequence of colors and sounds. It is a digital version of the classic Simon Says game, designed to test and improve memory skills.

# Features:

✔ Colorful Buttons: Four buttons light up in a random sequence.

✔ Memory Challenge: Players must remember and repeat the sequence.

✔ Sound & Animation Effects: Each button plays a unique sound when clicked.

✔ Progressive Difficulty: The sequence increases in length as the player progresses.

✔ Game Over & Restart Feature: If a player makes a mistake, the game resets.

# How To Play Game:

Press any key or click the start button (if available) to begin.

The game will flash a button as the first sequence.

2. Repeat the Sequence
